# 🧙‍♂️ Collector Quest
*Forge your legacy. Collect the extraordinary.*

Collector Quest is an alternate reality game (ARG) powered by AI and blockchain technology where players create unique characters and embark on quests tied to real-world artwork. Artists mint their physical creations as digital artifacts, and players uncover their magical properties through gameplay. As characters grow, communities unlock lore, level up realms, and leave behind a trail of relics.
