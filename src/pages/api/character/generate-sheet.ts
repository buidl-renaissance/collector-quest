Name: ${name}
Race: ${race}
Class: ${characterClass}
Background: ${background}
Bio: ${bio}
Sex: ${sex}

Traits:
- Personality: ${traits.personality?.join(", ")}
- Fear: ${traits.fear?.join(", ")}
- Memory: ${traits.memory}
- Possession: ${traits.possession}

Motivation: ${motivation}

Please generate a complete character sheet with the following sections:

1. Abilities (roll 4d6 drop lowest for each):
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

2. Combat Stats:
- Armor Class (10 + Dex mod)
- Initiative (Dex mod)
- Current Hit Points (based on class + Con mod)
- Hit Dice (based on class)

3. Skills (select appropriate skills based on class and background)

4. Combat & Equipment:
- Attacks & Spellcasting (based on class)
- Equipment (starting gear based on class and background)
- Select 5 Attacks in JSON format: ${JSON.stringify(attacks)} 

5. Features & Traits (from race and class)

6. Proficiencies & Languages (from race, class, and background)

7. Ideals, based on the character's bio
What drives your character?

These are your characterâ€™s guiding principles â€” what they believe in, what they strive for, or what moral code they follow.

ðŸ§  Mechanics & Use:
Ideals influence decision-making, alliances, and goals.

Often tied to alignment, but not strictly.

DMs (or systems like Collector Quest) can reward alignment with these ideals using inspiration or story benefits.

Examples in JSON: ${JSON.stringify(effects.ideals)}

8. Bonds, based on the character's bio
Who or what matters most to your character?

Bonds are personal connections â€” to people, places, objects, or events â€” that anchor your character in the world.

ðŸ§  Mechanics & Use:
Drive quest hooks, emotional stakes, or NPC relationships.

Help guide reactions in moral or social dilemmas.

A Bond can be threatened or used as leverage in narrative.

Examples in JSON: ${JSON.stringify(effects.bonds)}

9. Flaws, based on the character's bio
Whatâ€™s your greatest vulnerability or weakness?

Flaws reveal a characterâ€™s imperfections â€” the internal conflicts or bad habits that can lead to drama or mistakes.

ðŸ§  Mechanics & Use:
Drive complications and story tension.

A Flaw might lead to bad decisions but better roleplay.

Can be used by the DM or system to introduce challenges or even comic relief.

Examples in JSON: ${JSON.stringify(effects.flaws)}

10. Personality Traits, based on the character's bio

Personality traits are a collection of short phrases that describe the character's personality.ðŸŽ­ Personality Traits in Collector Quest
Personality traits define how your character thinks and behaves, adding depth to roleplay and shaping interactions with the world. They influence dialogue, decisions, and relationshipsâ€”both with NPCs and party members. Traits can lead to unique story moments, cause tension or teamwork, and may earn you rewards like inspiration when roleplayed well. Whether you're cautious, curious, or hot-headed, your trait helps make your character feel alive and reactive in the game world.

Examples in JSON: ${JSON.stringify(effects.personality_traits)}
